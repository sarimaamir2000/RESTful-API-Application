# RESTful-API-Application
This is a RESful API Application that is implemented on SpringBoot (a Java Framework), where the user can use CRUD operations to manage doctors' records. This was implemented on Eclipse IDE, and in order to use the commands, I used Postman in order to Add, Append, Delete or Get the record.
