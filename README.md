# RESTful-API-Application
This is a RESful API Application that is implemented on SpringBoot (a Java Framework), where the user can use CRUD operations to manage doctors' records. The initial file was created using Spring Initializer and the rest of the project was done on Eclipse IDE. I used Postman in order to do the CRUD operations.
